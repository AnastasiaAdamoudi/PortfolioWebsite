  "I am a frontend developer, enjoying the challenge of creating imaginative, functional and accessible websites. I enjoy working with JavaScript and React.js, as well as building server functionalities with Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB. I'm curious and eager to learn new technologies. My journey has been a diverse one, spanning various experiences including domiciliary care, private tutoring and volunteering, which have not only nurtured my communication, teamwork, and creative skills, but also equipped me with a people-centric perspective. ",
  "My journey has been a diverse and rewarding one, taking me through various experiences such as studying mathematics, working at customer service, engaging in private tutoring and volunteering. My coding journey started with a highschool programming class, where I was introduced to the basics of algorithmic thinking. One of my most profound experiences has been my time as a caregiver for vulnerable adults, which illuminated my innate desire to help others. It has also helped me develop my empathy and compassion; I now bring those qualities to my projects by following a people-first approach.",
  "Since graduating from the full-stack development bootcamp School of Code in 2023, I've been working on freelance projects, to further develop my coding skills while collaborating with individuals in need of web solutions. Additionally, I'm passionate about giving back to the community and I serve as a STEM Ambassador, going to weekly meetups with my local tech group and volunteering with them to inspire other people and show them the magic of technology.",
  "Beyond my career aspirations, I enjoy singing in a choir and going to yoga classes, finding the community aspect and the mutual goal all the participants have inspiring. Hiking and gardening help me connect with nature that feels like a second home to me. Last but not least, exploring local history and architecture, as well as the universe, feels exciting and meaningful as it helps me understand the world around me.",
  "As a web developer, I'm aiming to keep helping people and organisations fulfill significant goals, as well as promote accessibility and sustainability. I believe such causes make the world more inclusive and our planet healthier."
