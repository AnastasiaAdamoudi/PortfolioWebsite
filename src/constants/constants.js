There was a moment that I still remember vividly - there was nothing I wanted to do more than become a web developer. All those years of gradually putting myself through web experiences had led me to the understanding that my ultimate goal wasn't going to change. I then cried thinking about it; not from sadness that I hadn't done it yet, but from the strangely warm certainty that I was going to do it someday.

All those times when I was studying HTML and JavaScript, and it didn't really make sense to me... All those times I would only need to practice a bit more to see the first result of some interaction with the website's user, and then motivation would probably follow. But it's never too late to pursue your dreams and during that second week, it still felt surreal that I was actually the one creating that website interactivity.",

I struggled that week and it wasn't because I didn't understand how to code, but because I realised that the way my brain was wired all those years ago to think in such an analytical way wasn't exactly what is going to help me progress. It's knowing how to think that way but also understanding when to use React's reusable components and libraries. Technology isn't the same it was in 2009 when I made that first HTML website and fitting into the modern tech world comes with being open to adjust to changes and new more efficient ways of creating things.",

Our tech stack included React, which played a vital role in achieving code reusability, efficient state management, and the seamless deployment of our high-functioning frontend. On the backend, we employed Node.js and MongoDB to manage our plant data efficiently in a non-relational database. My contribution to this project was extensive and rewarding. I actively participated in the entire planning and design journey, where I shared creative ideas and played a pivotal role in designing wireframes and logos. Additionally, I worked diligently on the structure and functionality of the React frontend, ensuring a smooth user experience. As a team, we made sure to adhere to web accessibility standards throughout the app's development, providing an inclusive and user-friendly gardening platform. This project showcased the small, everyday progress we experienced, from design to coding challenges, and it was a testament to our collective dedication on this incredible journey."

In a world where we are conditioned to believe that success is synonymous with unceasing achievement, I learned to cherish the value of these seemingly small victories."

For this event, I created a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game on a frontend page, which the children not only grasped quickly but also had the chance to manipulate the code themselves to understand HTML, CSS, and even some JavaScript. Witnessing their excitement and smiles as they made changes to the page was a priceless reward. I completed my training and the entire process in August, looking forward to more activities as a STEM Ambassador."

Alongside remarkable individuals from Southend Tech, our mission was to once again ignite children's passion for coding. We delved into Scratch, Frontend Development, Python, and Microbits, witnessing the kids' creativity shine through in their fantastic projects. The weekend was a whirlwind of science-fueled fun, and being part of initiatives like this that make a real impact on our community was an absolute honor. Participating in the Women Who Code hackathon was an incredible journey filled with learning and collaboration. Joining forces with an exceptional team of designers, developers, and content creators, we took on the challenge to create a project for the Hackathon for Social Good 2023. My role as a backend developer involved integrating Passage for passwordless authentication, ensuring organized server code, and promoting web accessibility standards. It was a rewarding experience that showcased the power of teamwork and innovation in the realm of social impact technology."
