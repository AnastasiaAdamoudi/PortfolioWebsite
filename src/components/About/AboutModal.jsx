                My web development story starts with a highschool class that
                taught me the basics of algorithmic logic through interesting
                problem-solving tasks.

            "Introduction to computers" and "Introduction to programming" at
            university showed me the power of HTML and Object Oriented
            Programming. So much else - styling with CSS, interactivity with
            JavaScript - I discovered through online tutorials and exciting
            plans of what would happen when I managed to connect the dots.

            Until I decided it was time I got involved with web development
            professionally. I got accepted in the full-stack development
            bootcamp School of Code and for a few months my everyday routine
            consisted of teamwork on projects and learning by building. The dots
            were connected and it felt natural, like I was finally doing what I
            was supposed to be doing all along.

            has been an exciting and rewarding one. My other experiences -
            studying mathematics, working at customer service and volunteering -
            have been equally important, shaping who I am today. My recent time
            as a caregiver for vulnerable adults has helped me acknowledge my
            innate desire to help others. The compassion Iâ€™ve learned to develop
            while engaging with people has allowed me to follow a people-centric
            approach on my web development projects.

                Outside of work, I enjoy singing in a choir and going to yoga
                classes, inspired by people participating in communities with a common goal.
                Hiking in the great outdoors and gardening help me connect with nature and find
                balance in my life. Exploring local history and architecture
                feels exciting and meaningful as it helps me understand the
                world around me.
